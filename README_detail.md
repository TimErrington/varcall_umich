# Variant Calling and core SNP diagnostics Pipeline

**Synopsis**
---
This pipeline calls variants on PE/SE reads provided in a directory and generates core SNP/consensus fasta files that can be used to to build a phylogeny or as an input for Gubbins/Beast analysis

**Installation**
---
Pending


**Input** 
---
Input is a directory(-readsdir) containing SE/PE reads and a config file where all the parameters for the pipeline are set at the start of pipeline. This config file settings will be used universally on all samples. An example config file with default parameters are included in the pipeline folder. You can customize the config file and provide it with the -config argument. Detailed information in section [Customizing Config file]()

**Steps**
---

There are three main steps to generate core SNPs which should be provided with -steps argument.

**1. Variant Calling:** This step will run all the standard variant calling steps on sample read files residing in input reads directory. 
The possible options are:

Option ***All*** :  This will run all the variant calling steps starting from cleaning the reads to variant calling and generating intermediate files that will be used in later steps. 

Option ***clean,align,post-align,varcall,filter,stats*** :  This option will run variant calling steps starting from cleaning to variant calling.
You can modify this argument to run a part of the pipeline. For example, if you want to restart the pipeline from alignment step, you can do it by supplying the following option: "align,post-align,varcall,filter,stats" which will skip the Trimmomatic cleaning part.
The order of variant calling steps needs to be sequential to avoid any errors. 



Note, while skipping any of the steps, make sure the results for skipped steps are already present in your output folder.


**2. Preparing files for Core SNP extraction and diagnostics purposes:**


Option ***core_prep*** : Run this step before running the last core steps. This will prepare all the data required for the last core step.


**3. Generate Core SNP consensus and data matrix for diagnostics plots:**

Option ***core*** : This step will generate core SNP consensus fasta file and a consensus fasta of only core variant positions. Various data matrices will generated at this step that can be used later for diagnostics purposes. 


**Running pipeline on Compute cluster**(Supported system: pbs)
---


The variant calling can be run in parallel on each sample using the -cluster argument. Set the pbs resources such as resources(-l), email(-M), queue(-q), flux_account(-A) and notification(-m) under [scheduler] section in config file. For more details, check out UMICH [flux](http://arc-ts.umich.edu/systems-and-services/flux/) website.


Possible options for -cluster option:

***local*** : This is the default option. When this option is set, the pipeline will analyze each sample one after the another. This will not make use of multiple cores present in your system or clusters. Use this option for few number of samples or for testing purposes.

***parallel-local*** :  This option will run the pipeline and analyze samples in parallel but on a local system. This is preferred for less than 20 sample size input and multiple core local system.

***cluster*** : This option will run the pipeline on a single cluster. This option is similar to local but will rather run on a cluster node. It will not make use of multiple cores present on a cluster. Use this option for few number of samples or for testing purposes or for few number of large size samples which requires multiple cores to analyze individual samples.

***parallel-cluster*** : The pipeline is optimized for this option. When this option is set, the pipeline will run everything on a cluster making use of all the cores available. This option will also submit individual jobs for each sample seperately and whenever needed. When you set this option for each step in the pipeline, make sure all the jobs submitted by the pipeline at each step is completed before proceeding to another step. You can check the status of the job with: 

```
qstat -u USERNAME  
```

**Quick Start**
---

Run variant calling on a set of PE reads with default parameters

```
python /nfs/esnitkin/bin_group/pipeline/Github/variant_calling_pipeline/variant_call.py -type PE -readsdir /Path-To-Your/test_readsdir/ -outdir /Path/test_output_core/ -analysis output_prefix -index MRSA_USA_300 -steps All

```

The above command will run variant calling (step 1) pipeline on a set of PE reads residing in test_readsdir. The results will be saved in output directory test_output_core. The config file contains options for some frequently used reference genome. To know which reference genomes are included in config file, look up the config file or check the help menu of the pipeline.





**Customizing Config file:**
***

The pipeline implements customisable variant calling configurations using config file. Config file can be customised to use your choice of aligner and variant caller by changing two parameters under the section [pipeline]
Currently, The pipeline supports BWA aligner(mem algorithm) for aligning reads to the reference genome and samtools for variant calling.

```
# Set which tools to use in pipeline:
[pipeline]
# Options for Aligner:bwa / smalt / bowtie
aligner: bwa
# Options for variant_caller:  gatkhaplotypecaller /samtools
variant_caller: samtools

```

Make sure you have downloaded all the dependencies for the pipeline in a folder path provided in binbase option of [bin_path] section.

```
# Set bin folder path. Please make sure all the executables are placed in bin folder. Also make sure the path for individual tools are correct.
[bin_path]
binbase: /nfs/esnitkin/bin_group/variant_calling_bin/
```

NOTE: Add the required perl libraries(such as in the case of vcftools) PERL5LIB environment variable. 

Every tool has its own *_bin option where you can set the folder name in which the tool resides. For example, in the below Trimmomatic section example, the Trimmomatic tool resides in /Trimmomatic/ folder that is set with trimmomatic_bin option which in itself resides in /nfs/esnitkin/bin_group/variant_calling_bin/ folder that was set in binbase option above.

```
[Trimmomatic]
trimmomatic_bin: /Trimmomatic/
adaptor_filepath: adapters/TruSeq3-Nextera_PE_combined.fa
seed_mismatches: 2
palindrome_clipthreshold: 30
simple_clipthreshold: 10
minadapterlength: 8
keep_both_reads: true
window_size: 4
window_size_quality: 20
minlength: 40
headcrop_length: 0
colon: :
targetlength: 125
crop_length: 40
f_p: forward_paired.fq.gz
f_up: forward_unpaired.fq.gz
r_p: reverse_paired.fq.gz
r_up: reverse_unpaired.fq.gz
```

Parameters for each tools can be customised under the 'tool_parameter' attribute of each tool in config file.


For example, to change the minadapterlength parameter of Trimmomatic from 8 to 10, replace minadapterlength of 8 with suppose 10 and restart the pipeline.

**Log:**
***

The pipeline generates a log file following the naming convention: yyyy_mm_dd_hrs_mins_secs_analysisname.log.txt and tracks each event/command run by the pipleine. The log file sections follow the standard [Python logging conventions](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging.html): 
***INFO*** to print STDOUT messages; ***DEBUG*** to print commands ran by pipeline, ***ERROR*** to print STDERR messages and ***EXCEPTION*** to print an exception that occured while the pipeline was running.
